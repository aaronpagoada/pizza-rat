# PizzaRat
Pizza Rat is a Discord bot that will help you get from A to B, as long as you are in NYC!

## Commands
  * `t/fact`
  * `t/line`
  * `t/time`
  * `t/help`

## Notes
As of this commit, I am no longer working on this version of PizzaRat. I kept running into a problem that I cannot for the life of me figure out. The problem lies in the `.decode` method within the `gtfs-realtime-bindings` module.

However, I am still working on PizzaRat, but this time I'm using Python. The repository is public on my page.
